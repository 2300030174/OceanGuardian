## Overview

The locomotion system is responsible for enabling the Beach Cleaning Robot to navigate efficiently across various beach terrains. This document outlines the requirements, design considerations, and potential solutions for the locomotion system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Terrain Adaptability**
   - Must navigate through dry, loose sand
   - Must navigate through wet, compacted sand
   - Must handle slight inclines up to 15 degrees
   - Must handle small obstacles up to 5cm in height

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Minimum speed of 0.5 m/s on compacted sand
   - Minimum speed of 0.3 m/s on loose sand
   - Turning radius less than 0.5m for maneuverability
   - Must operate continuously for at least 4 hours

3. **Environmental Considerations**
   - Must be resistant to saltwater exposure
   - Must minimize sand ingestion into moving parts
   - Must not significantly disturb the beach surface
