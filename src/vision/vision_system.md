# Vision System Specification

## Overview

The vision system is a critical component of the Beach Cleaning Robot, enabling it to detect, classify, and localize waste objects on the beach while avoiding obstacles and sensitive natural elements. This document outlines the requirements, design considerations, and implementation approach for the vision system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Detection Capabilities**
   - Must detect common beach waste items (plastic bottles, bags, food wrappers, etc.)
   - Must distinguish between waste and natural objects (shells, seaweed, rocks)
   - Must identify potential obstacles for navigation
   - Must detect beach wildlife to avoid disturbance

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Minimum 85% detection accuracy for waste objects larger than 3cm
   - False positive rate below 15%
   - Processing latency below 200ms
   - Object detection range of at least 2 meters in front of the robot

3. **Environmental Adaptability**
   - Must function in varying lighting conditions (bright sunlight to overcast)
   - Must handle glare from wet sand and water surfaces
   - Must maintain functionality in light rain or sea spray
   - Must adapt to changing beach conditions (tide, wind-blown sand)

4. **Integration Requirements**
   - Must interface with the navigation system to inform path planning
   - Must provide location data for the collection mechanism
   - Must communicate with the data collection system for pollution mapping
   - Must operate within the power constraints of the robot platform

## Design Considerations

### Hardware Options

1. **Camera Configuration**
   - **Primary Forward Camera**: High-resolution RGB camera with wide field of view
   - **Supplementary Cameras**: Side and downward-facing cameras for comprehensive coverage
   - **Potential Configurations**:
     - Single wide-angle camera (simplest, but limited coverage)
     - Stereo camera setup (better depth perception)
     - Multi-camera array (comprehensive coverage, higher complexity)

2. **Sensor Types**
   - RGB cameras for color and texture information
   - Depth sensors (structured light, ToF, or stereo vision) for 3D localization
   - NIR (Near-Infrared) sensors for improved material differentiation
   - Optional multispectral imaging for specialized detection capabilities

3. **Hardware Specifications**
   - Resolution: Minimum 1080p for primary camera
   - Frame rate: 30 fps minimum
   - Field of view: At least 120Â° horizontal
   - Weather protection: IP65 or higher rating
   - Low-light sensitivity: Capable of operation at 10 lux

### Software Architecture

1. **Detection Pipeline**
   - Image pre-processing (normalization, noise reduction, glare handling)
   - Object detection (CNN-based models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN)
   - Object classification (waste type categorization)
   - Spatial localization (determining 3D position relative to robot)

2. **AI Model Considerations**
   - Model architecture selection based on accuracy vs. efficiency tradeoffs
   - Quantization for edge deployment
   - Transfer learning from existing waste detection models
   - Continuous online learning capability

3. **Processing Options**
   - Edge computing on dedicated vision processing unit
   - Distributed processing between low-level edge and higher-level onboard computer
   - Potential for cloud offloading for complex analysis (when connectivity available)

## Preliminary Design Direction

After initial analysis, the following design direction is proposed:

1. **Camera System**
   - Main forward-facing RGB-D camera (combined RGB and depth)
   - Two supplementary wide-angle RGB cameras for side visibility
   - Downward-facing camera for collection guidance
   - All cameras with IP67 protection and anti-glare coating

2. **AI Detection System**
   - Two-stage detection pipeline:
     - Stage 1: Fast, efficient detector for initial region proposals (MobileNet-SSD)
     - Stage 2: More accurate classifier for detailed waste categorization
   - Specialized models for wildlife detection to prevent disturbance
   - Beach-specific feature extraction for terrain understanding

3. **Processing Hardware**
   - Dedicated vision processing unit (e.g., Jetson Nano or equivalent)
   - Hardware acceleration for neural network inference
   - Low-power operation modes for energy efficiency

4. **Integration Features**
   - API for navigation system to receive obstacle and terrain information
   - Interface for waste collection system with precise location data
   - Data logging for environmental mapping and analysis

## Dataset Requirements

1. **Training Data Composition**
   - Minimum 10,000 labeled images of beach waste in diverse environments
   - Various lighting conditions (sunny, cloudy, dawn/dusk)
   - Different beach types (sandy, rocky, shells, vegetation)
   - Multiple angles and partially buried objects
   - Negative samples (natural beach items)

2. **Data Collection Methodology**
   - Controlled waste placement and photography
   - Real beach cleanup documentation
   - Synthetic data generation for rare scenarios
   - Data augmentation for lighting and perspective variations

3. **Annotation Requirements**
   - Bounding box or instance segmentation for each waste item
   - Classification by material type (plastic, glass, metal, etc.)
