# Beach Cleaning Robot Project

## 🌊 Mission
To develop autonomous robots capable of efficiently collecting waste from beaches while preserving the natural environment, contributing to cleaner oceans and shorelines worldwide.

## 🤖 Project Overview
The Beach Cleaning Robot is an open-source initiative to design, build, and deploy intelligent robots that can autonomously navigate beach environments and collect various types of waste. By combining robotics, computer vision, and environmental science, we aim to create a sustainable solution to beach pollution.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Terrain-adaptive locomotion for efficient sand navigation
- AI-powered waste detection and classification
- Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance
- Solar-powered operation for sustainability
- Data collection for pollution mapping and analysis
- Fleet management for coordinated cleaning operations
